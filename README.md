# Borderlands2-UVHM-Level1
Archive of Koby/Nifsara mod for UVHM from level 1

Koby deleted its UVHM from level 1 mod from the BL2 mod repository and it doesn't appear to be available online anymore except from the repository archive.

Here is an archive of the mod if you prefer to play this way.

Note that you will need to patch your executable to enable level 1 scaling of UVHM (patch is available through the Hex Multitool).
