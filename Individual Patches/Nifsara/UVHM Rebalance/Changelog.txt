2018/01/15: v.1.9

        Slag has received some tweaking.
        Does regular damage against Flesh and Armor. 
        Shielded targets take much less damage.
        
2018/01/15: v.1.8

        -Regular versions only-
        Halved enemy health at level 1, scaling by 3-4% every two levels, ending at default value by level 30.

2018/01/15: v.1.75

        Cutting enemy damage in 5 made the game stupid easy. It's now 1/3rd and climbing 3% every other level.
        Hard is still unaffected.

2018/01/15: v.1.7

        Enemies in both Regular versions have received a damage nerf to smoothen out low-level UVHM play.
        They start by only doing 1/5th of UVHM damage (0.22 instead of 1.1).
        Their damage scales by 3-4% every 2 levels, ending at their regular output of 1.1 at level 50.
        This should make elemental weapons, Torgue Gyrojets in particular, less lethal before you have the gear to survive.
        Needs further testing to see if Regular low-level UVHM becomes too easy.

2018/01/13: v.1.6,6,6

        A comma,

2018/01/13: v.1.666

        Updated both standard versions to actually work as expected at level 73+.
        Made optional UVHM+ modules for use with the UVHM+ main mod. As always, place my "Enemy Scaling" at the very bottom.
        
2018/01/12: v.1.5

        Made two versions with different scalings. 
        
        Regular: Enemies end up 50% weaker than vanilla UVHM. They start scaling from level 32 and stop at 50.
        Hard: Enemies end up 25% weaker than vanilla UVHM. They start scaling from level 2 and stop at level 50.

2018/01/12: v.1.2

        Enemy scaling has been retouched to be less punishing early on, when weapons and shields are scant.
        Slag damage has been reduced to 0.85 across the board.
        Axton's Sabre Turret has been made immune to the Slag debuff.
        Gaige's Deathtrap has been made immune to the Slag debuff.

2018/01/12: v.1.11

        Accidentally made Slag too weak against shielded targets.
        
2018/01/11: v.1.1

        Major update already?!
        
        -Enemy health and shield balanced for real. Let me know if it's okay now.
        -Movement speed penalty when slagged increased to 100% (halving movement speed).
        -Slag on shield damage buffed to 0.9.
        -Slag has been given a hidden multiplicative bonus of 25% chance to be applied universally (except on player).
        -Double ammo drop didn't work.
        
2018/01/11: v.1.01

        Badass health nerfed somewhat due to bosses and no Slag bonus damage. Needs further testing.

2018/01/11: v.1.0 - Initial release

        This mod is far from finished. I've spent more time in the Filter Tool than I have in-game. Things are probably going to be very unbalanced until I play through the game or get some feedback at various level brackets.
